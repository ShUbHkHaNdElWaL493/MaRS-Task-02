@ Project-01

The schematics for an interrupt-driven motor have been included in the following file.
The pushbuttons act as toggle switches and can be used to change the direction of rotation of the motor.
The connections for this design have been made using Arduino Uno for processing the inputs given by the pushbuttons.

The link to the circuit design for the motor has been attached:
