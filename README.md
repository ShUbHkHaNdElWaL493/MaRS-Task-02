Power Electronics and Control Systems: 

The electronic components of a circuit include resistors, capacitors, chokes and transistors. Resistors act as voltage varying components to manipulate the voltage given to certain components in a circuit. Capacitors help in stabilizing the voltage being provided to different parts of the circuit. Chokes are inductors that help in stabilizing the current being provided to different parts of the circuit. Transistors act as power distributers and logic gates that directly receive input about the voltage to be provided to different components of the circuit. The logic gate transistors are also known as MOSFETs.
